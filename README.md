The `{labtoolbox}` package provides functions to simplify and automate
common data analysis and presentation tasks for The Lab @ DC.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `{labtoolbox}` from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("thelabdc/labtoolbox")
```

## Example

This is where we will keep examples of the package’s functions.

``` r
library(labtoolbox)

# basic example code
```

(We use `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md` to include R chunks. We
still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly with
`devtools::build_readme()`.)
